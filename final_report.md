**Project Title:** Urban Houseplant Care & Watering Schedule App

---

### Project Features:
By the end of this course, the following features have been successfully implemented:
1. **Zero-Login Dashboard:** Instant access to the app's main interface without internet dependency or cloud authentication workflows.
2. **Local Plant Inventory (CRUD):** Users can add new plants, capture/crop photos, and save their data locally using Hive.
3. **Dynamic Care Scheduling:** Users can set custom, recurring intervals for watering, misting, and fertilizing.
4. **Offline Push Notifications:** Integration with the device's native OS to trigger local push notifications for scheduled care tasks (using `flutter_local_notifications`).
5. **Care History Timeline:** A logged history of when specific tasks were completed, stored securely on the device's internal storage.
6. **Embedded Offline Care Guide:** A bundled static JSON database containing detailed care instructions, sunlight requirements, toxicity warnings, and filtering options for popular houseplants. 
7. **Online Wikipedia Integration:** A hybrid search feature that fetches a live summary and image from the Wikipedia REST API if the user has an internet connection.

### Future Enhancements:
The following enhancements can be added to the current system to improve the overall functionality and user experience: 
1. **Light/Dark Sensor Integration:** Utilizing the phone's native ambient light sensor to tell the user if the current spot has enough light for a specific plant.
2. **Data Backup & Restore:** Allowing users to export their local Hive database to a JSON file or Google Drive so they don't lose their plant data when changing devices.
3. **Advanced Plant Recognition:** Integrating a local, on-device machine learning model (like TensorFlow Lite) to identify a plant's species automatically using the camera instead of manually searching.
4. **Weather API Integration:** Skipping watering notifications automatically if the local weather forecast predicts high humidity or rain for outdoor balcony plants.
